you will be able to see a new row in the left pane as Assigned Queries. 

// Assign Queries to Mentors-------------
From the Admin Account, click Assign Queries. you will be able to see the queries raised. It will also have a select option, that only shows mentors.
Assign them.

from the user and the mentor dashboard, you will be able to check the query and click on that and chat.


i tried to implement SocketIO, but i couldn't. so the page has to be refreshed after few mins to check if there is any reply.
once the query is cleared, the mentor will be able to change the status to close.
